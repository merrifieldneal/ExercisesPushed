git checkout -b
fast-forward means it was a clean merge that chronologically synced (no changes to main)
    recursive means there was conflict that had to be dealt with(changes to main)
git checkout
git branch -D 
Merge conflicts happen when there have been changes/commits made to both files
    and git cannot choose which to merge.
